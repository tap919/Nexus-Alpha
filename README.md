# Nexus Alpha

**Nexus Alpha** is an AI-native developer IDE and autonomous orchestration engine built directly in the browser. Powered by React, TypeScript, and Vite, it integrates full-stack generative capabilities with durable workflows, real-time collaborative editing, an embedded terminal, and a sophisticated vector database integration. With Google Gemini as its core reasoning engine, it transitions from a simple dashboard into a comprehensive, multi-modal development environment.

***

## Core Features

- **AI-Native IDE Experience** — Includes a Monaco-based browser editor (`@monaco-editor/react`), real-time collaborative editing via Yjs (CRDTs), and an embedded full terminal (`xterm.js`).
- **Multi-File Planning Engine** — Powered by the **PlannerAgent**, this engine decomposes complex prompts into structured, multi-file implementation plans before execution.
- **Architectural Review UI** — A dedicated review interface for inspecting and approving agent-led code modifications, ensuring human-in-the-loop control.
- **Graphify RAG** — Semantic codebase discovery using a knowledge graph integration (nodes, edges, communities) to reduce token usage and improve code recall accuracy.
- **Performance-Native Codegen** — Real-time performance profiling (Lighthouse vitals) integrated into the generation loop to ensure high-quality, optimized output.
- **Enterprise Audit & Hardening** — Comprehensive administrative dashboard for monitoring agent actions, security events, and cost, backed by zero-trust BOLA safeguards.
- **Self-Healing Loop (Auto-Fix 2.0)** — Autonomous repair engine with visual regression awareness and performance-based self-optimization.
- **Hono Backend Platform** — High-performance, authenticated backend proxies for all AI and system operations, featuring strict rate-limiting and audit logging.
- **Desktop Ready** — Pre-configured Electron build target for native desktop deployment.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** v9 or higher
- A **Google Gemini API key** (required) — get one at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev)
- Redis server (required for BullMQ)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tap919/Nexus-Alpha.git
cd Nexus-Alpha
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in your values. At minimum, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `NEXUS_API_KEY`.

### 4. Start the development servers

**Frontend (Vite):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Backend (Hono + WebSocket):**
```bash
npm run server
```

**MCP Server:**
```bash
npm run mcp
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Google Gemini API key for all AI features |
| `NEXUS_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Server-to-server API authentication key (required in production) |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | ✅ Yes | Secret key for JWT verification (enforces Zero-Trust RBAC) |
| `NEXUS_ALLOW_AUTO_FIX` | Optional | Set to `true` to enable unsandboxed destructive pipeline operations |
| `MAX_WS_CLIENTS` | Optional | Connection cap for WebSocket server |
| `PORT` | Optional | HTTP server port (default: `3002`) |

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` to version control. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
